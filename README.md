To run the project, open the root directory using Rider, and press run. I got 100% test coverage for every class.

You will find the UML diagrams in CS5700 HW3 Complete UML.pdf, CS5700 HW3 Patterns.pdf, and CS5700 HW3 Shapes.pdf. You will find sequence diagrams in files with "Sequence" in the title. The sequence diagram about shapes assumes that any shape aggregated from points (such as lines, circles, triangles, or even composites) could be the object in the center.

The report is in HW3 Report.pdf.
